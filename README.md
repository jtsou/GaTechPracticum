# GaTechPracticum

This is my graduation project, aimed at solving a real-world problem using machine learning methodologies and interactive visualizations created with Tableau Dashboard. Specifically, I focused on optimizing the Amazon Air site. Throughout this project, I encountered several challenges, such as acquiring the right data and collaborating with multiple stakeholders to understand the root cause and determine how the solution could add value. Additionally, due to the large amount of data, I had the opportunity to fine-tune my SQL queries and perform numerous ETLs.
